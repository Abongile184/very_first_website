<h1>About Gustavo</h1>

<h2>One day Uncle Gustavo</h2>

<div class = "center">
<div>
<p>
He wanted to break all the traditional catering schemes and set up a show kitchen so that his guests could ask at the
moment what caused them and that the kitchen catered to them to their liking. Crazy? </font>
Well, yes, but that's the way Uncle Gustavo is, when he gets something in his
head, he goes and does it.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p> 
And he went to the market, bought a kitchen, pots and other utensils. She chose ingredients for all the dishes she wrote
down on a blackboard, more than 30 different options, and told family and friends that the kitchen would be open from 7
pm until the chicken broth was served at dawn.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
And that's how the Gustavo's Cuisine was born. They followed the bars on the birthday of the wife, the children and then
the nephews began to call. They also wanted Uncle Gustavo cooking at their parties ... and he didn't stop. Today Gustavo
accompanies his nephews on their most important days, the guests enjoy their food ... as much as they want, as
many times as they want and of course, instantly, prepared especially for each one.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
There is no better dish than the one prepared instantly especially for you. That is the specialty of Gustavo.
